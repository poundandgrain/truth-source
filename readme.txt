Broadcasts message to various environments to modify the content source of truth.

== Description ==

Source of Truth is a plugin maintained P&G that allows administrators to create a list of environments (UAT, Dev, production etc) and coordinates who is the current source of truth for maintaining WordPress content.

At a glance, this plugin adds the following:

* Administrators can add / remove environments.
* Administrators can ensure token matches on multiple environments to securly (?) communicate.

In addition, the Source of Truth plugin includes several filters that show different messages on all various environments weather they are or are not the current source of truth. If not, the message links to the current SOT.
